This is a prototype using [VIKUS Viewer](https://github.com/cpietsch/vikus-viewer) to present a selection of Nationalmuseum's paintings. The prototype, along with three other prototoypes, was developed in the context of a wider evaluation of generous interfaces. This evaluation work has been carried out in cooperation between the the Swedish National Heritage Board, the Nordic museum, Nationalmuseum, Malm√∂ museums, and the Swedish Museums of World Culture.

Note that the VIKUS Viewer is not optimised for use on mobile devices, so try it out on you desktop or laptop!
